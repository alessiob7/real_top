REAL_TOP

This is an example project basically written in PHP.
This was made for verify if after a time of study, I can work alone with PHP, JQuery, HTML/CSS languages.

This should be a very simple social network (feel free to increase it's feature).
You can add an user by registering it, show a profile page and delete the user.
You can also add to a hardcoded id_user (in this example id=0) fiendlist an user that you can choose.

All is supported by a simple 3-table MySQL database.
Feel free to try this, but don't forget to edit in db_connect.php the constants for connecting to DB.

I can give u a copy of the db if you need it.
